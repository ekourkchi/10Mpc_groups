# galaxy groups within 10 Mpc

Based on the similar formalism as in KT2017 groups paper.  
The sample is much more restricted, with the 10 Mpc limit.  
The sample of objects within this limit is not substantially change; except now (almost) all the distances that will be used are well defined by TRGB measurements.  
**The exceptions:** for about 30 galaxies that are above a luminosity threshold of M_B = -13 we still donâ€™t have TRGB measurements and the distances are crude.  This is 10% of the sample above the magnitude limit.)

All the objects in the current file have good distances (except for the 31 cases mentioned, which have only distance estimates).  
So no need to use radial velocities at all.  
We just use distances, and the SGXYZ coordinates built from them.
